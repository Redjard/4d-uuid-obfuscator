# 4D UUID Obuscator

A mod for [4D Miner by Mashpoe](https://mashpoe.com/4d-miner), based on [Tr1NgleDev's 4dm.h modding framework](https://github.com/4D-Modding/4dm.h).

The UUID is the string your account on a server is tied to, if anyone knows your UUID they can access all accounts on all servers you visited. If you join a server, the admin can see your UUID.

This mod changes the UUID based on the server address, so the owner of a server sees a UUID that is only used on their server.
